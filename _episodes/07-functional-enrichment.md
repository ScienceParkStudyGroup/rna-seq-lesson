# 1. Introduction: functional enrichment

You've finally managed to extract a list of differentially expressed genes from your comparison. Great job! 
But...now what? :question: :confused:

Why did you do the experiment in the first place? Probably because you had an hypothesis or you were looking to open new leads. 

A functional enrichement analysis will determine whether some functions are enriched in your set of differentially expressed genes. 

In this tutorial, we are looking for Arabidopsis leaf genes that are induced or repressed upon inoculation by _Pseudomonas syringae_ DC3000 after 7 days.
One important goal is to gain a higher view and not only deal with individual genes but understand which pathways are involved in the response. 

Once we obtain a list of genes, we have multiple analysis to perform to go beyond a simple list of genes:
- Annotating our list of genes with cross-databases identifiers and descriptions (Entrezid, Uniprot, KEGG, etc.).
- Performing Enrichment and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analyses using R or webtools.
- Integrate transcriptomic results in the context of metabolic pathways (data integration).


# 2. Annotating your DE genes

We are going to use two fantastic resources: the superb [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org) databases and the marvelous [biomartr package](https://docs.ropensci.org/biomartr).
Together, they will automate a lot of tedious and tiring steps when you want to retrieve gene annotations, sequences, etc.

We are going to load the required library first. 
~~~
library(biomartr)
library(clusterProfiler)
library(tidyverse)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(org.At.tair.db))
library("biomaRt")  # only use to remove cache bug
~~~
{: .language-r}

## 2.1 Load the table of differential genes

~~~
diff_genes <- read_delim(file = "differential_genes.tsv", delim = "\t")
~~~
{: .language-r}

All what we know about the differential genes are their locus identifier. Not much....
We are missing functional information which we will add. 

## 2.2 Ensembl databases 
Gene information can be automatically queried directly from R to access the [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org) databases. 
Ensembl gathers a tremendous amount of genomic information which can be accessed through a web browser or programmatically. 

> The Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) is a system for generating and distributing genome annotation such as genes, variation, regulation and comparative genomics across the vertebrate subphylum and key model organisms. The Ensembl annotation pipeline is capable of integrating experimental and reference data from multiple providers into a single integrated resource. Here, we present 94 newly annotated and re-annotated genomes, bringing the total number of genomes offered by Ensembl to 227. 

<img src="../img/07-ensembl.png" alt="Portal of Ensembl for Arabidopsis" width="1000px">

## 2.3 Querying Ensembl databases using biomartr

What purpose serves `biomartr`? From the documentation:
> The first step, however, of any genome based study is to retrieve genomes and their annotation from databases. To automate the retrieval process of this information on a meta-genomic scale, the biomartr package provides interface functions for genomic sequence retrieval and functional annotation retrieval. The major aim of biomartr is to facilitate computational reproducibility and large-scale handling of genomic data for (meta-)genomic analyses. In addition, biomartr aims to address the genome version crisis. With biomartr users can now control and be informed about the genome versions they retrieve automatically. Many large scale genomics studies lack this information and thus, reproducibility and data interpretation become nearly impossible when documentation of genome version information gets neglected.

This indicates that we can get a dataset called `athaliana_eg_gene` of the genome annotation version `TAIR10` from the `plant_mart` mart.

# 3. Gene Ontology Over Representation Analysis (ORA) 

Over Representation Analysis is searching for biological functions or pathways that are enriched in a list obtained through experimental studies compared to the complete list of functions/pathways.  

Usually, ORA makes use of so-called gene ontologies (abbreviated GO) where each gene receives one or multiple layers of information on their function, cellular localization, etc.

Perhaps the most famous is the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) resource which we will use.    

The ORA analysis rely on this mathematical equation to compute a p-value for a given gene set classified under a certain GO. 

$$p = 1 - {\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {M \choose i}{N - M \choose n - i} \over {N \choose n}}$$  

In this formula: 
- **N** is the total number of genes in the background distribution. Also called the "universe" of our transcriptome.
- **M** is the number of genes within that distribution that are annotated (either directly or indirectly) to the gene set of interest.
- **n** is the size of the list of genes of interest (the size of your "drawing").
- **k** and k is the number of genes within that list which are annotated to the gene set. 

The background distribution by default is by default all genes that have annotation. You can change it to your specific background if you have a good reason for that (only genes with a detectable expression in your expression for instance). Also, p-values should be adjusted for multiple comparison.

Do you remember your math classes from high school? Now's the time to get them to work again!

Binomial coefficient is defined as $${n \choose k}$$ and is equal to $$n! \over {k! (n-k)!}$$

See this [great chapter](https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/chapter2.html) from Prof. Guangchuang Yu (School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, China) for more info.

## 3.1 ClusterProfiler (R code)

To perform the ORA within R, we will use the [clusterProfiler Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) that has an [extensive documentation available here](https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/index.html). 

### 3.1.1 Enrichment analysis
First, we need to annotate both genes that make up our "universe" and the genes that were identified as differentially expressed.
~~~
# building the universe!
all_arabidopsis_genes <- read.delim("counts.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)[,1] # directly selects the gene column

# we want the correspondence of TAIR/Ensembl symbols with NCBI Entrez gene ids
attributes_to_retrieve = c("tair_symbol", "uniprotswissprot","entrezgene_id")

# Query the Ensembl API
all_arabidopsis_genes_annotated <- biomartr::biomart(genes = all_arabidopsis_genes,
                                                     mart       = "plants_mart",                 
                                                     dataset    = "athaliana_eg_gene",           
                                                     attributes = attributes_to_retrieve,        
                                                     filters =  "ensembl_gene_id" )  

# for compatibility with enrichGO universe
# genes in the universe need to be characters and not integers (Entrez gene id)
all_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id = as.character(
  all_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id) 

~~~
{: .language-r}

We now have a correspondence for all our genes found in Arabidopsis. 

~~~
# retrieving NCBI Entrez gene id for our genes called differential
diff_arabidopsis_genes_annotated <- biomartr::biomart(genes = diff_genes$genes,
                                                     mart       = "plants_mart",                 
                                                     dataset    = "athaliana_eg_gene",           
                                                     attributes = attributes_to_retrieve,        
                                                     filters =  "ensembl_gene_id" )  
~~~
{: .language-r}

This gave us the second part which is the classification of genes "drawn" from the whole gene universe. The "drawing" is coming from the set of genes identified as differential (see [episode 06](../06-differential-analysis/index.html)).  

~~~
# performing the ORA for Gene Ontology Biological Process class
ora_analysis_bp <- enrichGO(gene = diff_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id, 
                            universe = all_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id, 
                            OrgDb = org.At.tair.db,  # contains the TAIR/Ensembl id to GO correspondence for A. thaliana
                            keyType = "ENTREZID",
                            ont = "BP",              # either "BP", "CC" or "MF",
                            pAdjustMethod = "BH",
                            qvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                            readable = TRUE, 
                            pool = FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Since we have 3 classes for GO terms i.e. Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC) and Biological Processes (BP), we have to run this 3 times for each GO class. 

> ## Exercise
> How many GO categories do you find overrepresented (padj < 0.05) for the Cellular Component and Molecular Function classes?
{: .challenge}

~~~
ora_analysis_all_go <- enrichGO(gene = diff_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id, 
                                universe = all_arabidopsis_genes_annotated$entrezgene_id, 
                                OrgDb = org.At.tair.db,
                                keyType = "ENTREZID",
                                ont = "ALL",             
                                pAdjustMethod = "BH",
                                qvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                                readable = TRUE, 
                                pool = FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

The Gene Ontology classification is very redundant meaning that parental terms overlap a lot with their related child terms. The `clusterProfiler` package comes with a dedicated function called `simplify` to solve this issue. 

~~~
# clusterProfiler::simplify to disambiguate which simplify() function you want to use
ora_analysis_all_go_simplified <- clusterProfiler::simplify(ora_analysis_bp) 
~~~
{: .language-r} 

The `ora_analysis_all_go_simplified` is a rich and complex R object. It contains various layers of information (R object from the S4 class). Layers can be accessed through the "@" notation.

You can extract a nice table of results for your next breakthrough publication like this. 
~~~
write_delim(x = as.data.frame(ora_analysis_all_go_simplified@result), 
            path = "go_results.tsv", 
            delim = "\t")

### 3.2.1 Plots
Nice to have all this textual information but an image is worth a thousand words so let's create some visual representations. 

A dotplot can be created very easily. 
~~~
dotplot(ora_analysis_all_go)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../img/07-dotplot.png" width="800px">

You can also create an enrichment map that connects GO terms with edges between overlapping gene sets. 
This makes it easier to identify functional modules. 

~~~
emapplot(ora_analysis_bp, color = "qvalue", size = "Count")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../img/07-emaplot.png" width="800px">

On this plot, we can see that one major module related to cell death, the immune response etc. is to be seen along with two minor modules 
related to metabolism (upper left) and one related to jasmonic acid and wounding (bottom).


> ## Important note
> Remember to perform the analysis for all GO categories: Biological Process (`ont = "BP"`), Cellular Component (`ont = "CC"`) and Molecular Function (`ont = "MF"`).

## 3.2 AgriGO v2.0 (webtool)
AgriGO v2.0 is a webtool [accessible here](http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/index.php) to perform gene ontology analyses. Two papers describe it extensively (see [8.2. References](#82-references)).

From the AgriGO v2.0 home page:  
> AgriGO v2.0 is a web-based tool and database for gene ontology analyses. It specifically focuses on agricultural species and is user-friendly. AgriGO v2.0 is designed to provide deep support to the agricultural community in the realm of ontology analyses. 

You can find an [extensive manual available here](http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/manual.php) to guide you through the main steps.


> ## Important note
> There are two versions of AgriGO currently online, versions 1.x and version 2.0. Make sure you go to the [latest 2.0 version url](http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/index.php).
{: .callout} 

### 3.2.1 Single Enrichment Analysis
**We can perform a Single Enrichment Analysis (SEA) which is essentially similar to an ORA.** AgriGO supports species-specific analyses.   
For _Arabidopsis thaliana_ [navigate here](http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/specises_analysis.php?SpeciseID=1&latin=Arabidopsis_thaliana).

First, write gene identifiers to a text file from which you can copy-paste the identifiers. Here, we use the complete list of the 4979 genes
differentially regulated (DC3000 versus Mock) but you can filter it on some criteria (e.g. fold change). This is what I've done to gather less genes and speed up the SEA analysis.
~~~
diff_genes %>% 
  filter(log2FoldChange > 0) %>% 
  with(.,quantile(log2FoldChange, c(0.5,0.75,0.9)))

diff_genes %>% 
  filter(log2FoldChange > quantile(log2FoldChange, c(0.75))) %>% # keeping fold changes above the 75th percentile
  dplyr::select(genes) %>% 
  write.table(., file = "diff_genes_for_agrigo.tsv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Open this list using a text editor and copy-paste it into the "input a gene list" box. 

<img src="../img/07-agrigo-1.png" alt="input gene list for arabidopsis" height="400px">

You will then have to choose a background (your "universe") to perform the SEA/ORA analysis. For _Arabidopsis thaliana_, you can choose the suggested background (TAIR10). 

<img src="../img/07-agrigo-2.png" alt="choice of the background and statistical test" height="400px">

I suggest to use the hypergeometric distribution and the Yekutieli False Discovery Rate correction. The significance threshold and the minimum number of entries can be changed depending on the size of your input gene list. 

If you have a long list, you might write your email address to collect your results later (analysis might take a while). You will arrive on a result page from which you can generate graphs, barplots, tables etc. 

<img src="../img/07-agrigo-3.png" alt="results of SEA analysis" height="50%">

This DAG view gives a comprehensive overview of the GO terms and their relationships. 

### 3.2.2 Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment
This analysis takes expression values also into account and could be an richer alternative to SEA. 

~~~
diff_genes %>% 
  filter(log2FoldChange > quantile(log2FoldChange, c(0.75))) %>% 
  dplyr::select(genes, log2FoldChange) %>% 
  write.table(., file = "diff_genes_for_agrigo_page.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../img/07-agrigo-4.png" alt="results of PAGE analysis" height="50%">



## 3.3 Metascape (webtool)
Left to the reader. The basic usage is to copy-paste a list of gene identifiers (preferably Entrez id) inside the box.
Visit the [Metascape website here](https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1). 

> ## Important note
> Metascape is restricted to 3000 genes so you will have to split our big list first into chuncks less < 3000 genes.
> ~~~
> pos_diff_genes = diff_genes %>% filter(log2FoldChange > 0) 
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
> Then write the `pos_diff_genes` to a text file and copy-paste the list of genes.
{: .callout}

## 3.4 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is another way to investigate functional enrichment of genes and pathways using the Gene Ontology classification. 
Please refer to [the following section](https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/chapter2.html) in Prof. Guangchuang Yu book for a clear explanation of GSEA and how to implement it with `clusterProfiler`.

# 4. KEGG Over Representation Analysis (ORA) 
KEGG stands for the "Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes". From the [KEGG website home page](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/):
> KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies.

Instead of using the Gene Ontology gene classification, one might be interested to use KEGG classification to view the
transcriptomic response of an organism. KEGG is not restricted to metabolic functions but has a great deal of metabolic maps that can help you. 


To see if your organism is referenced in the KEGG database, you can search this page: https://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html
In our case, _Arabidopsis thaliana_ is referenced as "ath" in the KEGG database. 
 
You can also do this programmatically using R and the `clusterProfiler` package.

## 4.2 KEGG Modules ORA

[The KEGG MODULE datase](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/module.html) is more dedicated to metabolism and can help you to make sense of transcriptomic data using metabolic maps and modules. 

The complete list of available modules is [available here](https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/get_htext).

# 5. Troubleshooting

If biomart refuses to query Ensembl again, run this command:
~~~
biomaRt::biomartCacheClear() # to solve a known bug https://github.com/BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks/issues/335
~~~
{: .language-r}

This will clean the cache memory and allow to perform the Ensembl query again.
