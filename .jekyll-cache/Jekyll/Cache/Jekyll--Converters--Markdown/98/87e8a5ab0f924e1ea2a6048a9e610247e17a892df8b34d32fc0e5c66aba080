<h1 id="what-you-will-learn-in-this-lesson">What you will learn in this lesson</h1>

<ol>
  <li><strong>What are the important things to know before doing an RNA-Seq experiment</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When should you perform a RNA-Seq experiment?</li>
      <li>RNA-Seq experiments have to comply with good experimental design practices just like any experiment.</li>
      <li>What are biological replicates and why are they important?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How to assess the quality of my RNA-Seq experiment at the sample-level</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">FastQC</code> to perform quality checks on each sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">fastq</code> sequencing file.</li>
      <li>What are some count normalization methods? Why are RPKM, FPKM and TPM <em>not</em> adequate methods.</li>
      <li>Calculating <code class="highlighter-rouge">DESeq2</code> size factors with R to compare potential bias between samples sequencing depth, etc. Understand why we need to normalise counts for sample-level QC.</li>
      <li>Plot a scree plot from a PCA analysis to verify that the first principal components explain most of the total observed variation.</li>
      <li>Creating a PCA plot to visualise the grouping of samples in relation to the experimental factors being investigated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How to perform a differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq results using R</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Raw counts are used for differential expression <em>not</em> scaled counts.</li>
      <li>Creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DESeq2</code> object requires 3 items: the raw gene counts, the sample to condition correspondence and a formula for testing.</li>
      <li>How does the DESeq method works? What are the outputs obtained using <code class="highlighter-rouge">DESeq2</code>?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What are the typical outputs that one can obtain from  a differential gene expression analysis?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A table of genes being differentially regulated between two conditions.</li>
      <li>A volcano plot shows the relationship between <script type="math/tex">log_{2}</script> fold change and the adjusted p-value for each gene.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How to go beyond a list of differential genes and interpret its biological meaning</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>By performing an over-representation analysis (ORA), one can find pathways or categories where differential genes are significantly more abundant.</li>
      <li>By performing a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), one first ranks differentially expressed genes before comparing enrichment scores for whole pathways.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How to perform transcriptomic and metabolomic data integration</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform gene identifier conversion to retrieve common metabolic identifiers such as Uniprot IDs or KEGG IDs.</li>
      <li>Overlay genes on a metabolic map with iPath 3.</li>
      <li>Search for enriched metabolic KEGG pathways and modules.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="dataset-used">Dataset used</h1>

<p>We will make use of a published experimental dataset from a study made on the small model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14036">Vogel et al. (2016)</a>. This study compares the response of 4 weeks old plantlets to different bacteria that live on the leaves of different plant species:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A known foliar pathogen called <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> strain DC3000.</li>
  <li>A commensal (“neutral”) bacteria called <em>Methylobacterium extorquens</em> strain PA1.</li>
  <li>A commensal (“neutral”) bacteria called <em>Sphingomonas melonis</em> strain Fr1.</li>
</ul>
