    <ul>
      <li>When should you perform a RNA-Seq experiment?</li>
      <li>RNA-Seq experiments have to comply with good experimental design practices just like any experiment.</li>
      <li>What are biological replicates and why are they important?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How can I assess the quality of my RNA-Seq sequencing results?</strong>
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How do I perform a differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq results using R?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Raw and scaled counts: why do you need to scale counts between samples?</li>
      <li>What are the gene expression units I need to know: RPKM, FPKM, TPM.</li>
      <li>What are robust scaling/normalisation methods?</li>
      <li>How does the DESeq method works?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What are the plots that I can make from the differential analysis results?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Heatmap coupled with gene and sample clustering.</li>

<h2 id="dataset-used">Dataset used</h2>

<p>We will make use of a published experimental dataset from a study made on the small model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14036">Vogel et al. (2016)</a>. This study compares the response of 4 weeks old plantlets to different bacteria that live on the leaves of different plant species:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A known foliar pathogen called <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> strain DC3000.</li>
  <li>A commensal (‚Äúneutral‚Äù) bacteria called <em>Methylobacterium extorquens</em> strain PA1.</li>
  <li>A commensal (‚Äúneutral‚Äù) bacteria called <em>Sphingomonas melonis</em> strain Fr1.</li>
</ul>
