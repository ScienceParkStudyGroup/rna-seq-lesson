# Introduction

Q1 (0.5 point): In the publication of Deforges et al. 2019, the first paragraph of the “Material and Methods” section describes how plants were sown and treated (see paragraph below). 
What are the full names of each of the 4 hormones used? 
“””
Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were germinated on agar-solidified half-strength MS medium for 10 d, after which the seedlings were flooded with a solution of half-strength MS containing 5 µM IAA, 10 µM ABA, 10 µM MeJA, 10 µM ACC, or no hormone for the untreated control. After 3 h of incubation, roots and shoots were split and harvested separately. For each of the 12 experimental conditions, 3 independent biological replicates were carried out at different times.
“””
Names are: IAA auxin, ABA abscissic acid, ACC 1-amino-1-cyclopropane and MeJA methyljasmonate.  

Q2 (0.5 point): Can you name 3 different types of RNA that can be studied using RNA sequencing?
- Long non-coding RNAs.  
- Messenger RNAs.   
- microRNAs. 

Q3 (0.5 point): What is the sequencing platform used in this experiment? How many reads were obtain on average per sample?   
Illumina HiSeq 2500, about 30 million reads per sample.   
> "The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina sequencer and about 30 million of paired-end reads per sample were obtained."

Q4: (0.5 point): In the article, can you find a good complete one-sentence long definition of cis-NATs?  
>"Cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs."

   
# Exercise 1: data import

We first load the `tidyverse` package that contains most of the data transformation
functions we will need. 
```{r import libraries}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse")) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("apeglm"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("DESeq2"))
```


## Import gene counts 
```{r import raw gene counts, echo=TRUE}
raw_counts <- read.csv(
  file = "../gene_counts_and_samples2conditions/dataset03_ACC_arabidopsis_root_raw_counts.csv",
  header = TRUE, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  # for DESeq subsequent data import 
  column_to_rownames("gene")

# first five rows
head(raw_counts, n = 5)
```

Q5: Can you determine how many genes are present in the table? 

```{r}
nrow(raw_counts)
```
There are `r nrow(raw_counts)` genes in the "dataset_01_IAA_arabidopsis_root_raw_counts.csv" table. 


Q6 (1 point): determine the minimum and maximum gene expression in the control condition and in the hormone-treated condition. 	
Hint: if you use the tidyverse package to do this, use “pivot_longer()” to get your data tidy and create a new column for the biological replicate number. 
Find the gene that has the maximum count in the control condition and auxin-treated conditions. 


```{r}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  separate(sample, into = c("tissue","condition","rep"), sep = "_") %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(minimum = min(counts), maximum = max(counts))
```
Gene max in control condition. 
```{r}
# 519267
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  separate(sample, into = c("tissue","condition","rep"), sep = "_") %>% 
  filter(counts == "519267")
```
Gene max in ACC-treated condition. 
```{r}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  separate(sample, into = c("tissue","condition","rep"), sep = "_") %>% 
  filter(counts == "452411")
```

## Distribution of counts

Q7 (1 point):   
A) plot the distribution of the gene counts of one sample using either the base R hist() function or the ggplot2 geom_histogram() function. What can you say about the distribution of the gene counts?  
B) How can you display the distribution of an scale that better represents the distribution? Think about data transformation or the axis. 

```{r, out.height="30%"}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  filter(sample == "root_control_1") %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = counts)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The count distribution is very skewed with a lot of data with counts < 50,000 counts. A few genes have a very high count number with the maximum being 479,700 counts.

We can transform the data before plotting or use a transformed scale. Here, I use a log10 transformation with an offset of 1 (so that genes with 0 counts become log10(0+1)=0).  
```{r, out.height="30%"}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  filter(sample == "root_control_1") %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = log10(counts + 1))) + # log10 transform with offset
  geom_histogram()
```

# Exercise 2: differential expression

This `DESeqDataSet` object is used to store both data (gene counts) and metadata 
(sample to experimental condition correspondence) in one unique R object. 
Functions can be directly be applied to this object and corresponding results stored
within the same object. 

## Import samples to condition

Q8 (0.5 point) Upload the “arabidopsis_root_hormones_samples_to_condition.csv” file to your R virtual machine. Then import this file into R and name the object samples_to_conditions. 
- Make a table that shows the number of biological replicates by condition. 
- Filter this table to keep only “control” samples and the samples related to your hormone of interest. You should have 6 samples in total (3 control and 3 hormone-treated). 


```{r}
samples_to_conditions <- read.csv(
  file = "../gene_counts_and_samples2conditions/arabidopsis_root_hormones_sample2conditions.csv",
  stringsAsFactors = F) %>% 
  filter(condition == "ACC" | condition == "control") %>% 
  mutate(condition = factor(condition, levels = c("control","ACC")))

table(samples_to_conditions$condition)
```

```{r}
levels(samples_to_conditions$condition)
```

## Create the DESeqDataSetFromMatrix object

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, 
                              colData = samples_to_conditions, 
                              design = ~ condition)
```

You can have a quick peek at the number of genes, number of samples, etc. by calling
the `dds` object. 
```{r dds peek}
dds
```

## Call differential genes

Q9 (0.5 point): using the raw_counts and the samples_to_conditions, create a DESeqDataSet object called dds that will be used for DESeq2 differential analysis. 
Call the differential genes using the DESeq() function and call this object diff_genes. Filter this object to keep only the significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.01). 
Hint 1: the gene identifiers have to be assigned to the row names of raw_counts. 
Hint 2: convert the diff_genes object to a dataframe with “dds = as.data.frame(dds)”.

```{r call diff genes}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

```{r}
diff_genes <- results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "ACC", "control")) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01)
head(diff_genes)
```

## Number of diff genes and max log2FC

Q10 (0.5 point): how many genes are differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.01)? 
How many genes are positively regulated in response to the hormone treatment?   
How many genes are negatively regulated in response to the hormone treatment?   

```{r}
pos <- diff_genes %>% filter(log2FoldChange > 0) %>% nrow()
neg <- diff_genes %>% filter(log2FoldChange < 0) %>% nrow()
```

- Total number of genes diff. regulated (padj < 0.01) is `r nrow(diff_genes)` genes.  
- Total number of genes _positively_ & diff. regulated (padj < 0.01) is `r nrow(pos)` genes.  
- Total number of genes _negatively_ & diff. regulated (padj < 0.01) is `r nrow(neg)` genes.   

Q11 (0.5 point) : display a table of the top 20 positively differentially expressed genes based on their log2 fold change.   
What is the maximum positive log2fold change? Convert this log2 fold change to the untransformed fold change value = revert the log2 transformation.       

```{r}
top20 <- 
  diff_genes %>% 
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>% 
  head(n = 20)
top20
#knitr::kable(top20)
```

Max log2 fold change is equal to 3.7 This corresponds to a fold change of 2^3.7 = 13. Therefore the AT5G38930 gene is 13 times more expressed in ACC-treated seedlings than in control conditions. 

\newpage

# Exercise 3: volcano plot

## Shrinkage
Q12 (0.5 point): Shrink the log2 fold changes in order to shrink high log2 fold changes from lowly expressed genes. Use the related DESeq2 function that we have seen in the tutorial: https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/06-differential-analysis/index.html#3-volcano-plot  
- First, extract the results completely with “results(dds, …)”
- Then shrink the log2 fold changes with the “lfcShrink()” function and the “normal” shrinkage estimator. Call this new object res_shrink. 

```{r shrink fold changes coming from low-expressed genes}
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds = dds, 
                    type = "apeglm",
                    coef = "condition_ACC_vs_control") 
```


## Volcano plot
Q13 (1 point): make a volcano plot, a type of scatterplot that shows, for each gene, the magnitude of the shrinked log2 fold change (x-axis) versus statistical significance (adjusted p-value) as seen in the tutorial. Use the “res_shrink” object that you have built in the previous task. 
Hint: make sure you change the default “FCcutoff” and “pCutoff” values so that they better reflect your min/max log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values. Do not keep the default values for these two parameters.

```{r volcano plot, out.height="70%"}
library("EnhancedVolcano")
EnhancedVolcano(toptable = resLFC,
                x = "log2FoldChange",
                y = "padj",
                lab = rownames(resLFC),
                xlim = c(-4, +4),
                ylim = c(0,100),
                pCutoff = 0.01,
                transcriptPointSize = 2.0,
                FCcutoff = 0.5, 
                title = "Volcano plot",
                legend=c(
                  'Not significant',
                  'Log2 fold-change (but do not pass p-value cutoff)',
                  'Pass p-value cutoff',
                  'Pass both p-value & Log2 fold change')) + 
  guides(legend = NULL)
```

Q14:
- Most up-regulated genes: top right of the volcano plot.  
- Most down-regulated genes: top left of the volcano plot.  
- Most statistically significant genes are the highest on the y-axis.

# Exercise 4: find annotation of the 5 selected candidate genes

Q15 (1 point): for each of your 5 selected genes, make a plot showing their expression in control and hormone-treated seedlings. 

Select based on:  
1. Highest log2 fold change, then  
2. Highest baseMean  

```{r}
diff_genes %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  filter(log2FoldChange > 0) %>% 
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>% 
  head(n = 20) %>% 
  arrange(desc(baseMean)) 
```

Markakis 2012:  
> "The most up regulated gene identified by the microarray is the ARGOS gene (Auxin-Regulated Gene Involved in Organ Size), which was shown to control aerial organ size by influencing the number of cells, and not the size of cells. Further experiments suggested that this gene provides a link between hormone control and cell cycle activity through ANT and CYCD3;1 [23]. Besides expression in the aerial organs, ARGOS was also detected in the root tip and the pericycle, but no root phenotype was observed in plants with experimentally induced changes in expression levels [24]. As ACC/ethylene stimulate auxin biosynthesis and transport [11], it makes sense that upon addition, a highly auxin-responsive gene like ARGOS was detected in the microarray."

## AT2G41230 = OSR1

**Names**: ORGAN SIZE RELATED 1

Description: Promotes cell proliferation-dependent organ growth. Takes part in the AXR1-dependent auxin signaling pathway that requires ANT during organogenesis.

Feng 2011:  
> "These observations indicate that OSR1 has a role in regulation of organ growth and final organ size."  
> "Here, we identified the OSR1 gene, which regulates organ growth by affecting both cell proliferation and cell expansion, and functions through prolonged expression of ANT, as does ARGOS."   
> "Furthermore, OSR1 is up-regulated by ethylene but repressed by ABA and BR."   
> "OSR1 predominantly regulates cell proliferation but also affects expansion. In addition, overexpression of OSR1 or ARGOS suppresses the expression of ARGOS and/or ARL, suggesting that these genes are co-regulated in plants. Therefore, our results, together with the recent work on OsARGOS (Wang et al., 2009), suggest that the members of the OSR family may be co-evolved factors that are involved in the coordination of cell proliferation and expansion in plant development."
