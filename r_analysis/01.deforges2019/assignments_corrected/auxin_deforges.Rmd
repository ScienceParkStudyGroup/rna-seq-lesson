# Introduction

Q1 (0.5 point): In the publication of Deforges et al. 2019, the first paragraph of the “Material and Methods” section describes how plants were sown and treated (see paragraph below). 
What are the full names of each of the 4 hormones used? 
“””
Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were germinated on agar-solidified half-strength MS medium for 10 d, after which the seedlings were flooded with a solution of half-strength MS containing 5 µM IAA, 10 µM ABA, 10 µM MeJA, 10 µM ACC, or no hormone for the untreated control. After 3 h of incubation, roots and shoots were split and harvested separately. For each of the 12 experimental conditions, 3 independent biological replicates were carried out at different times.
“””
Names are: IAA auxin, ABA abscissic acid, ACC 1-amino-1-cyclopropane and MeJA methyljasmonate.  

Q2 (0.5 point): Can you name 3 different types of RNA that can be studied using RNA sequencing? 
- Long non-coding RNAs. 
- Messenger RNAs. 
- microRNAs. 

Q3 (0.5 point): What is the sequencing platform used in this experiment? How many reads were obtain on average per sample?   
Illumina HiSeq 2500, about 30 million reads per sample.   
> "The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina sequencer and about 30 million of paired-end reads per sample were obtained."

Q4: (0.5 point): In the article, can you find a good complete one-sentence long definition of cis-NATs?  
>"Cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NATs), which overlap protein coding genes and are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, constitute an important group of noncoding RNAs."

   
# Exercise 1: data import

We first load the `tidyverse` package that contains most of the data transformation
functions we will need. 
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse")) 
```


## Import gene counts and sample to conditions
```{r import raw gene counts, echo=TRUE}
raw_counts <- read.csv(
  file = "../gene_counts_and_samples2conditions/dataset01_IAA_arabidopsis_root_raw_counts.csv",
  header = TRUE, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  # for DESeq subsequent data import 
  column_to_rownames("gene")

# first five rows
head(raw_counts, n = 5)
```

Q5: Can you determine how many genes are present in the table? 

```{r}
nrow(raw_counts)
```
There are `r nrow(raw_counts)` genes in the "dataset_01_IAA_arabidopsis_root_raw_counts.csv" table. 


Q6: what is the minimum and maximum gene expression in the control and IAA-treated conditions?

```{r}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  separate(sample, into = c("tissue","condition","rep"), sep = "_") %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(minimum = min(counts), maximum = max(counts))
```
```{r}
# 519267
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  separate(sample, into = c("tissue","condition","rep"), sep = "_") %>% 
  filter(counts == "519267")
```


Q7 (1 point):   
A) plot the distribution of the gene counts of one sample using either the base R hist() function or the ggplot2 geom_histogram() function. What can you say about the distribution of the gene counts?  
B) How can you display the distribution of an scale that better represents the distribution? Think about data transformation or the axis. 

```{r}
raw_counts %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  pivot_longer(- gene, values_to = "counts", names_to = "sample") %>% 
  filter(sample == "root_control_1") %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = counts)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The count distribution is very skewed with a lot of data with counts < 50,000 counts. A few genes have a very high count number with the maximum being 479,700 counts.


## Create the DESeqDataSet object

This `DESeqDataSet` object is used to store both data (gene counts) and metadata 
(sample to experimental condition correspondence) in one unique R object. 
Functions can be directly be applied to this object and corresponding results stored
within the same object. 

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, 
                              colData = sample2condition, 
                              design = ~ condition)

```

You can have a quick peek at the number of genes, number of samples, etc. by calling
the `dds` object. 
```{r dds peek}
dds
```

## Calculate size factors and scale gene counts

The median ratio method is used to calculate the size factor correction for each 
sample (mainly corrects for library sequencing depth but not only).
```{r}
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
sizeFactors(dds)
```
Since most of these size factors are comparable, it suggests that the sequencing depth
and other possible biases are not heavily affecting the gene count levels. 

Let's scale (= correct) gene counts accordingly. Since we have already calculated
and saved the size factors in the `dds` object, we can run:
```{r}
scaled_counts = counts(dds, normalized = TRUE) 
```

Save this data as a `.csv` file. 
```{r}
write.csv(x = scaled_counts, 
          file = "../01.desforges2019/scaled_counts.csv",
          quote = FALSE,
          row.names = TRUE)
```

## Plot the raw and scaled counts next to one another
Plot the raw counts. 
```{r}
p_raw <- 
  raw_counts %>%
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  gather(key = "sample", value = "gene_counts", - gene) %>% 
  mutate(gene_counts_log = log10(gene_counts + 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = sample, y = gene_counts_log)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgrey") +
  labs(y = "Raw gene counts (log10 transformed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
p_raw
```

Plot the scaled counts. 

```{r}
p_scaled <- 
  scaled_counts %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>% 
  gather(key = "sample", value = "gene_counts", - gene) %>% 
  mutate(gene_counts_log = log10(gene_counts + 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = sample, y = gene_counts_log)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen") +
  labs(y = "Scaled gene counts (log10 transformed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
p_scaled
```

We can plot them side by side using the `patchwork` library. 
```{r}
library("patchwork")
p_raw + p_scaled
```


Q5: The scaling procedure ensures that gene counts are corrected for potential bias affecting the final gene counts e.g. different sequencing depth per sample. It uses
the median of ratios method to calculate a correction factor: `estimateSizeFactors()`
One can see on the last plot that gene count medians are more similar after scaling.

# Exercise 2: Principal Component Analysis

The PCA analysis will be used to show the distance between samples. To do so, we will create a so-called score plot. 
The PCA will also tell us how much of the total variance can be explained by the first
two principal components. 

A PCA analysis acts as a sample-level quality check of our experiment:
- Are the samples from the same condition grouped together?
- Are the first two principal components (PC1, PC2) explaining a major percentage of the 
total variation present in the dataset?
- Are the samples from different experimental conditions well separated by PC1 and PC2?

If "yes" is the answer to these questions, then the experiment can be considered a success.

## Variance stabilisation

The PCA is very sensitive to mean-variance relationship. We first stabilise the variance
so that it becomes independent from the mean. 

```{r}
dds = estimateDispersions(object = dds, 
	                      fitType = "parametric", 
	                      quiet = TRUE)

vsd = varianceStabilizingTransformation(
  object = dds,
  blind = TRUE, # do not take the design formula into account. 
                # best practice for sample-level QC
  fitType = "parametric")

# extract the matrix of variance stabilised counts
variance_stabilised_counts <- assay(vsd)
```

We need to have samples in rows and genes in columns. The `scaled_counts` object 
has to be transposed before computing the PCA.
```{r transpose scaled counts}
t_variance_stabilised_counts <- t(variance_stabilised_counts)
```

## PCA function

Let's import the `mypca()` function.   
Source: https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/05-descriptive-plots/index.html#53-the-iris-data-set 

```{r}
source("../mypca.R")
```

## PCA computation: screeplot

```{r}
pca_results <- mypca(t_variance_stabilised_counts, 
                     center = TRUE, 
                     scale = TRUE)
```

The `pca_results` contains the scores, loadings and explained variance. 

## Scree plot

The scree plot shows the percentage of the total variance explained by each principal components. Here, with 6 samples, we can compute a maximum of 6 PCs. 

```{r scree plot}
percentage_variance <- as.data.frame(pca_results$explained_var)

# make the plot
scree_plot <- 
  percentage_variance %>% 
  rownames_to_column("PC") %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = PC, y = exp_var)) +
    ylab('explained variance (%)') + 
    ggtitle('explained variance per component') + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")
scree_plot
```

Q6: PC1 and PC2 explain 34.9% and 25.8% of the total variance respectively. 

## Sample score plot

In the same dataframe, PCA sample scores are combined with their experimental condition. 

```{r sample scores}
scores <- pca_results$scores %>% 
  rownames_to_column("sample") %>% 
  left_join(., y = sample2condition, by = "sample")

knitr::kable(scores, digits = 5)
```

Create the score plot.
```{r score plot creation}
p_score_plot <- ggplot(scores, aes(PC1, PC2, color = condition)) +
  geom_point(size = 6) +
  xlab(paste0("PC1: ",percentage_variance[1,],"% variance")) +
  ylab(paste0("PC2: ",percentage_variance[2,],"% variance")) + 
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("Sample score plot (variance stabilised") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12))
p_score_plot
```


Q7: the samples from the control group are grouped together on both PC1 and PC2.
That is not as clear for samples from the auxin-treated group since these are separated
on both PC1 and PC2. Yet, this experiment can be considered good enough to continue since the experimental condition is clearly reflected by PC1. Since PC1 account for the majority of the variance, the differential gene expression should give consistent results. 

\newpage

# Exercise 3: differential expression

## Calling differential genes

```{r call diff genes}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
diff_genes <- results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "auxin", "control")) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

```{r nb of genes differiential}
diff_genes_signif <-  
  diff_genes %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01) %>% 
  nrow()
```

Q8: `r diff_genes_signif` genes out of a total of `r nrow(diff_genes)` genes.

## Top 20 genes

By filtering first on the adjusted p-value (should be < 0.01) and then by ordering the genes by their absolute log2FoldChange, we can visualise the top 20 most significant differentially regulated genes.
```{r top 20}
diff_genes %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>%
  head(n = 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Since "we called "auxin" was used as the numerator in the `results()` function, 
a positive log2FoldChange indicates that the gene is up-regulated by the application
of auxin in Arabidopsis roots. 

```{r auxin upregulated}
genes_upregulated_by_auxin <- 
  diff_genes %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>%
  head(n = 20) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(log2FoldChange > 0)


knitr::kable(genes_upregulated_by_auxin, 
             digits = 3)
```

Q9: `r nrow(genes_upregulated_by_auxin)` are up-regulated by auxin. 

## Maximum and minimum log2 fold changes

What are the maximum and minimum log2 fold changes from these top 20 genes? 

__Maximum__
```{r max}
max_logfc <- 
  diff_genes %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>% 
  pull(log2FoldChange) %>%  
  max()
```

The maximum log2FoldChange in response to auxin is `r max_logfc`. 
This corresponds to a fold change of `r 2^max_logfc`. (2^foldchange).

The expression of the AT3G23635 gene in auxin-treated seedlings is `r 2^max_logfc` 
higher than in control seedlings. 


```{r min}
min_logfc <- 
  diff_genes %>% 
  filter(padj < 0.01) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(abs(log2FoldChange))) %>% 
  pull(log2FoldChange) %>%  
  min()
```

The minimum log2FoldChange in response to auxin is `r min_logfc`. 
This corresponds to a fold change of `r 2^min_logfc`. 

The gene AT1G05650 is expressed `r 1/2^min_logfc` times higher (1/min) in control seedlings than in auxin-treated seedlings.

# Exercise 4: volcano plot

## Shrinkage
Shrinkage prevents 

```{r shrink fold changes coming from low-expressed genes}
diff_genes <- results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "auxin", "control")) 

resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds = dds, 
                    res = diff_genes,
                    type = "normal",
                    coef = 2) 
```

## Volcano plot
```{r volcano plot}
library("EnhancedVolcano")
EnhancedVolcano(toptable = resLFC,
                x = "log2FoldChange",
                y = "padj",
                lab = rownames(resLFC),
                xlim = c(-7, +7),
                ylim = c(0,50),
                pCutoff = 0.01,
                transcriptPointSize = 2.0,
                FCcutoff = 1, 
                title = "Volcano plot",
                legend=c(
                  'Not significant',
                  'Log2 fold-change (but do not pass p-value cutoff)',
                  'Pass p-value cutoff',
                  'Pass both p-value & Log2 fold change')) + 
  guides(legend = NULL)
```

Q11: 
- Most up-regulated genes: top right of the volcano plot. 
- Most down-regulated genes: top left of the volcano plot. 
- Most statistically significant genes are the highest on the y-axis. 

Q12: the volcano plot is well balanced since it seems that the number of up- and down-regulated genes is comparable. 

Q13: The minimum and maximum log2 fold changes have been altered (see below) by the shrinkage.   
The minimum is now `r min(resLFC$log2FoldChange, na.rm = TRUE)`.  
The maximum is now `r max(resLFC$log2FoldChange, na.rm = TRUE)`.  
The limits of the volcano plot have been changed accordingly. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(broom::tidy(
  summary(
    resLFC$log2FoldChange)
  )
)
```
